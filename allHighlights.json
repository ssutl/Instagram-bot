This is a nonstarter—nothing can justify that sacrifice. Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a hotdogs-for-dinner standard of living. Even one million is chump change in a world where traditional retirement could span 30 years and inflation lowers your purchasing power 2–4% per year. The math doesnt work.3The golden years become lower-middle-class life revisited. Thats a bittersweet ending. If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, hardworking machine. If thats the case, guess what? One week into retirement, youll be so damn bored that youll want to stick bicycle spokes in your eyes. Youll probably opt to look for a new job or start another company. Kinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesnt it?”",

Or gazed at the sun into the fading night? You better slow down. Dont dance so fast. Time is short. The music wont last. Do you run through each day On the fly? When you ask: How are you? Do you hear the reply? When the day is done, do you lie in your bed With the next hundred chores Running through your head? Youd better slow down. Dont dance so fast. Time is short. The music wont last. Ever told your child, Well do it tomorrow? And in your haste, Not see his sorrow? Ever lost touch, Let a good friendship die Cause you never had time To call and say, Hi? Youd better slow down. Dont dance so fast. Time is short. The music wont last. When you run so fast to get somewhere You miss half the fun of getting there. When you worry and hurry through your day, It is like an unopened gift thrown away. Life is not a race. Do take it slower. Hear the music Before the song is over.”",

Somehow he never got around to the last trick. As months went by the young man became so proficient in the art that he bested everyone who dared to face him in the ring. He was so proud of his prowess that one day he boasted before the sultan that he could readily whip his master, were it not out of respect for his age and gratitude for his tutelage. The sultan became incensed at this irreverence and ordered an immediate match with the royal court in attendance. At the gong the youth barged forward with a lusty yell, only to be confronted with the unfamiliar 360th feint. The master seized his former pupil, lifted him high above his head, and flung him crashing to the ground. The sultan and the assembly let out a loud cheer. When the sultan asked the master how he was able to overcome such a strong opponent, the master confessed that he had reserved a secret technique for himself for just such a contingency. Then he related the lamentation of a master of archery, who taught everything he knew. No one has learned archery from me, the poor fellow complained, who has not tried to use me as a butt in the end.”",

Since we have constructed the concept of time, we are also able to mold it to some degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a child is long and slow, with vast expanses; the time of an adult whizzes by frighteningly fast. Time, then, depends on perception, which, we know, can be willfully altered. This is the first thing to understand in mastering the art of timing.”",

It strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for reflection and doubt.”",

The cult of Mithras, the Aryan god of light, had spread from Persia through Asia Minor to Greece, Rome, and as far as the Germanic lands and Britain. Numerous ruins of his shrines still testify to the high regard in which this god was held, especially by the Roman legions, as a bringer of fertility, peace, and victory. So it was a clever move when, in the year A.D. 354, the Christian church under Pope Liberius (352-366) co-opted the birthday of Mithras and declared December 25 to be the birthday of Jesus Christ.”",

After centuries of wrestling with wind and waves, ancient sailors devised contraptions that harnessed these forces of nature to fill in for man. They were simple but ingenious solutions, like the sheet-to-tiller system, which is still used today (Figure 1-1). To rig it, you simply take the jib sheet (the rope that controls the smaller sail up front) and run it around a pulley and back across the deck. Finish by tying the bitter end to the tiller (the stick that steers the boat). Now, when a gust hits and the boat starts to round up into the wind, the jib will pull the rope around the pulley and yank the tiller, steering the vessel back the opposite way.”",

To rig it, you simply take the jib sheet (the rope that controls the smaller sail up front) and run it around a pulley and back across the deck. Finish by tying the bitter end to the tiller (the stick that steers the boat). Now, when a gust hits and the boat starts to round up into the wind, the jib will pull the rope around the pulley and yank the tiller,”",

The driver is no longer required to monitor the drive, but must be ready to manually override within a given timeframe if the system requests it. Level 4 is High Automation. The system can take over all driving operations within a defined use case, and the driver has no part to play in either monitoring or back-up. Finally, Level 5, or Full Automation, sees the system take over the entire dynamic driving task in all use cases.

The problem can be defined as finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. One of the best-known shortest path algorithms is Dijkstras algorithm [6] as shown in Figure 4.1. The algorithm starts by initializing the distance value of all nodes to infinity. For all directly reachable nodes from the starting node a new distance value or cost is calculated, and the value is updated if the distance is shorter. This process iterates through the entire graph until all nodes have been traversed. The shortest path to any destination can now be determined by summing the cost of the node and the set of registered edges to reach that node. Faster algorithms, such as Contraction Hierarchies [9], perform some precomputation steps to speed up the process.”",

Suitable representations include occupancy grids or driving corridors. As explained in the previous chapter, in occupancy grids, the vehicles environment is divided into 2D grid cells. Each cell in the grid contains the probability of that cell being occupied by an obstacle. Driving corridors represent the free space in which the vehicle can travel without collision by taking into account all detected obstacles as well as other physical boundaries, such as the allowed lane and road boundaries. Each representation has its advantages and disadvantages. While the construction of occupancy grids is generally not computationally intensive, they tend to require more memory as the memory consumption increases proportionally to the total number of cells in the grid and the resolution of the grid. On the other hand, driving corridors always provide continuous collision-free space for the vehicle to move, but are generally more computationally intensive to construct.”",

He liked to say that the CIA was in turn watching his back in the United States, allowing him to sell cocaine with impunity. This claim would spark a belief that still seethes to this day, especially among urban blacks, that the CIA itself was the chief sponsor of the American crack trade.”",

The night owls in the group would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning larks, on the other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and woken at five a.m. Consequently, the group as a whole is only collectively vulnerable (i.e., every person asleep) for just four rather than eight hours, despite everyone still getting the chance for eight hours of sleep. Thats potentially a 50 percent increase in survival fitness. Mother Nature would never pass on a biological trait—here, the useful variability in when individuals within a collective tribe go to sleep and wake up—that could enhance the survival safety and thus fitness of a species by this amount. And so she hasnt.”",

They will enter deep sleep with just one half of the brain (opposing in each), leaving the corresponding left and right eye of each bird wide open. In doing so, they provide full panoramic threat detection for the entire group, maximizing the total number of brain halves that can sleep within the flock. At some point, the two end-guards will stand up, rotate 180 degrees, and sit back down, allowing the other side of their respective brains to enter deep sleep.”",

Much like selecting intentional filters on an Internet search or a shopping app, spindles offer a refining benefit to memory by allowing the storage site of your hippocampus to check in with the intentional filters carried in your astute frontal lobes, allowing selection only of that which you need to save, while discarding that which you do not.”",

It is very likely that you have been part of this experiment, otherwise known as daylight savings time. In the Northern Hemisphere, the switch to daylight savings time in March results in most people losing an hour of sleep opportunity. Should you tabulate millions of daily hospital records, as researchers have done, you discover that this seemingly trivial sleep reduction comes with a frightening spike in heart attacks the following day. Impressively, it works both ways. In the autumn within the Northern Hemisphere, when the clocks move back and we gain an hour of sleep opportunity time, rates of heart attacks plummet the day after. A similar rise-and-fall relationship can be seen with the number of traffic accidents, proving that the brain, by way of attention lapses and microsleeps, is just as sensitive as the heart to very small perturbations of sleep. Most people think nothing of losing an hour of sleep for a single night, believing it to be trivial and inconsequential. It is anything but.”",

Indeed, these emotional regions of the brain are up to 30 percent more active in REM sleep compared to when we are awake!”",

During these postmortem investigations, they discovered a loss of almost 90 percent of all the cells that produce orexin. Worse still, the welcome sites, or receptors, of orexin that cover the surface of the power station of the brain stem were significantly reduced in number in narcoleptic patients, relative to normal individuals. Because of this lack of orexin, made worse by the reduced number of receptor sites to receive what little orexin does drip down, the sleep-wake state of the narcoleptic brain is unstable, like a faulty flip-flop switch. Never definitively on or off, the brain of a narcoleptic patient wobbles precariously around a middle point, teeter-tottering between sleep and wakefulness.”",

Surely, after being so dedicated to slumber across the first two nights after learning, you can now cut loose, knowing those memories have been safely secured and fully processed within your memory banks.

Those at the far left and right ends of the row arent so lucky. They will enter deep sleep with just one half of the brain (opposing in each), leaving the corresponding left and right eye of each bird wide open. In doing so, they provide full panoramic threat detection for the entire group, maximizing the total number of brain halves that can sleep within the flock.

The spiral strands of DNA in your cells float around in the nucleus, but are tightly wound together into structures called chromosomes, rather like weaving individual threads together to make a sturdy shoelace. And just like a shoelace, the ends of your chromosomes need to be protected by a cap or binding tip. For chromosomes, that protective cap is called a telomere. If the telomeres at the end of your chromosomes become damaged, your DNA spirals become exposed and your now vulnerable genetic code cannot operate properly, like a fraying shoelace without a tip.”",

Soon millions of people are using his service and John finds himself entertaining buyout offers and venture capital investments. Despite having no revenue and no profit, John has built an asset that has value to the marketplace. He receives a $640 million offer for his service from the Webs leading search engine. John declines, arguing that his business will be worth more money once he starts generating revenue. While this is true, it is a gamble. After 18 months, Johns social networking service falls out of vogue, proving that the service was nothing more than a fad. The company becomes a bad party joke. In search of glowing valuations on a declining property, John no longer receives investor or buyer interest. He realizes too late that he should have taken the $640 million and experienced a liquidation event. He eventually sells the company at a fire-sale price of $2.5 million to a private equity firm. His poor timing cost him more than $600 million.”",

She was a single mom, struggling to the pay the bills, living paycheck to paycheck. For her, $500 was an extraordinary amount, and because of that, she priced her works far below their true value. Her own corrupted vision of price distorted her earning power and degraded the perceived value of her work. I suggested a price increase. Take that $90 painting, make it $300, and see what happens. Sure enough, she sold just as much art at the higher price, because price implies value and defines brands.”",

Goals that cannot be satisfied, no matter how much effort one makes. This is the classic trichotomy of the easy, the hard, and the impossible.”",

There is a tradeoff between laser surgery (a precise surgical procedure) and radiation therapy, which is toxic to both patient and cancer. Statistically, laser surgery may have worse five-year outcomes than radiation therapy, but the latter tends to create second tumors in the longer run and offers comparatively reduced twenty-year disease-specific survival. Given that the window used for the calculation of patient survival is five years, not twenty, the incentive is to shoot for radiation. So the doctor is likely to be in the process of shifting uncertainty away from him or her by electing the second-best option.”",

So it may suffice to have a tiny percentage—say, no more than 5 percent—of an evenly spatially distributed population of non-genetically modified eaters for the entire population to have to eat non-GMO food. How? Say you have a corporate event, a wedding, or a lavish party to celebrate the fall of the Saudi Arabian regime, the bankruptcy of the rent-seeking investment bank Goldman Sachs, or the public reviling of Ray Kotcher, chairman of Ketchum the contemptible public relations firm, the enemy of scientists and scientific whistleblowers. Do you need to send a questionnaire asking people if they eat or dont eat transgenic GMOs and reserve special meals accordingly? No. You just select everything non-GMO, provided the price difference is not consequential. And the price difference appears to be small enough to be negligible, as (perishable) food costs in America are largely, up to about 80 or 90 percent, determined by distribution and storage, not the cost at the agricultural”",

The neuron applies no intelligence when assessing those input signals; it simply adds up the excitatory signals and subtracts from them the inhibitory signals. If the net input over a short period is large enough, the neuron fires, sending its own signal (which may be either excitatory or inhibitory) to the other neurons to which it is connected.”",

This is a nonstarter—nothing can justify that sacrifice. Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a hotdogs-for-dinner standard of living. Even one million is chump change in a world where traditional retirement could span 30 years and inflation lowers your purchasing power 2–4% per year. The math doesnt work.3The golden years become lower-middle-class life revisited. Thats a bittersweet ending. If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, hardworking machine. If thats the case, guess what? One week into retirement, youll be so damn bored that youll want to stick bicycle spokes in your eyes. Youll probably opt to look for a new job or start another company. Kinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesnt it?”",

Or gazed at the sun into the fading night? You better slow down. Dont dance so fast. Time is short. The music wont last. Do you run through each day On the fly? When you ask: How are you? Do you hear the reply? When the day is done, do you lie in your bed With the next hundred chores Running through your head? Youd better slow down. Dont dance so fast. Time is short. The music wont last. Ever told your child, Well do it tomorrow? And in your haste, Not see his sorrow? Ever lost touch, Let a good friendship die Cause you never had time To call and say, Hi? Youd better slow down. Dont dance so fast. Time is short. The music wont last. When you run so fast to get somewhere You miss half the fun of getting there. When you worry and hurry through your day, It is like an unopened gift thrown away. Life is not a race. Do take it slower. Hear the music Before the song is over.”",
